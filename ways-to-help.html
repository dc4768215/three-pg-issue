        <p><a id="link" href="https://www.ssbx.org/"><b>Sustainable South Bronx</b></a></p>
        <p>Founded by Majora Carter in 2001, Sustainable South Bronx (SSBx) began out of a desire to advocate for parks and green development in the South Bronx and to promote environmental justice in a neighborhood that has borne, and continues to bear, a heavy environmental burden for the rest of the city. In 2015, we joined forces with The HOPE Program, a leading workforce development organization in New York City, to expand our impact through holistic, best-in-class green jobs training.</p>
        <p><a id="link" href="https://nyc-eja.org/"><b>New York City Environmental Justice Alliance</b></a></p>
        <p>NYC-EJA empowers its member organizations to advocate for improved environmental conditions and against inequitable environmental burdens by the coordination of campaigns designed to inform City and State policies. Through our efforts, member organizations coalesce around specific common issues that threaten the ability for low-income communities of color to thrive. NYC-EJA is led by the community-based organizations that it serves, with its board elected by its member groups, who set policy and guide program development.</p>
        <p><a id="link" href="https://www.jamesbaldwinoutdoorlearningcenter.org/"><b>The James Baldwin Outdoor Learning Center</b></a></p>
        <p>A nonprofit organization whose mission is to strive for inquiry and project-based solutions at the juncture of food, environmental and social justice. Their goal is to build a healthier and greener Bronx community by engaging, educating and serving students and community members.

The organization has a myriad of programs with the goal to engage and educate the community. From their Garden Community, and Farmers Market to their internship and food relief programs and even their Harvest Festival and Spring Banquet, the James Baldwin Outdoor Learning Center has a dedication to a more sustainable Bronx.</p>
        <p><a id="link" href="https://www.greenworker.coop/"><b>Green Worker Cooperatives</b></a></p>
        <p>Green Worker Cooperatives build, grow, and sustain worker-owned green businesses to create a strong, local, and democratic economy rooted in racial and gender equity––Specifically for the immigrant communities and communities of color in the South Bronx. They achieve this with their Co-Op Academy, which is an intensive 5-month long training and support program that helps teams of aspiring entrepreneurs develop worker-owned green businesses. Essentially it is a business boot camp for cooperative start-ups. </p>
        <p><a id="link" href="https://bronxriver.org/"><b>The Bronx River Alliance</b></a></p>
        <p>The Bronx River Alliance serves as a coordinated voice for the river and works in harmonious partnership to protect, improve and restore the Bronx River corridor so that it can be a healthy ecological, recreational, educational and economic resource for the communities through which the river flows.</p>
        <p><a id="link" href="https://outerseedshadow.org/"><b>Outer Seed Shadow</b></a></p>
        <p>The OSS utilizes urban farming, storytelling, educational programming and community building to dismantle systemic and structural issues of social inequity. With two operating gardens in the Bronx––Marble Hill and Terrace––the OSS Project hosts over 30 pluse gardeners who grow organic food for themselves and the extended community. They also host workshops on healthy cooking, nutrition literacy, medicinal plants, renewable energy, sustainability, self-sufficiency and more.</p>
